## Usage
To initiate the program, simply run the menu.ipynb file located in the view folder.

## GUI
This graphical user interface (GUI) is designed for ease of use, ensuring a seamless experience. 
The buttons are intuitively placed, making their functionality straightforward and user-friendly. 
For example, the download function buttons are label as Download and are all the same colour across the GUI.
The design prioritizes simplicity, allowing users to effortlessly navigate and utilize the program's features.

###Note
-While utilizing the GUI, it's important to note that the clear button does not reset the graphs. 
Instead, the graphs dynamically update based on the inputted variables. While the clear button won't erase the graphs, 
it allows users to refine and modify visualizations according to the changing input parameters, 
ensuring a dynamic and responsive experience.
Nevertheless, it does reset the lists and variables that are inserted.
-The downloaded lists are created in the view folder.
